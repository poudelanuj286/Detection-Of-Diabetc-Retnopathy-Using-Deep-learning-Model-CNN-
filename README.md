Method to run this project
1) first download datasets from kaggle competition. There are all together 5 classes.You canb see in metadata.


2) use splitting_datasets.py code to split the images to respective foldrrs.

3) run preprocessing.ipynb for preprocessing. You should note one thing while running all the notebook. Image path used in these code are for mine change it according to yours.

3) Run dataaugumentation.ipynb for data augumentation. i,e to increase images on respective class. In this you only need to augument data for class laebel 3 and 4(mostly).

4) run Model_and_training.ipynb to for training.

5) After saving model, run prediction.ipynb to predict the result.
